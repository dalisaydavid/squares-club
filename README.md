# Squares Club


2d Multiplayer game where you player as a square. Join the club. Created with the Godot game engine.


### Run the Game
You can find separate executables for the Client and Server for each platform here: https://urodela.itch.io/squares-club.

### Development

The repo currently has 2 Godot projects, separated by Server and Client. You must run each one of those separately to order to run the game as a local network. You can export either the client as an executable and run the server through the Godot UI (or vice versa).
